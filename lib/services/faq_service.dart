Affected leaves may wither and drop prematurely, reducing photosynthesis. Severe cases can lead to defoliation, affecting tuber development and crop yield. The disease can also affect stems and fruit.",
      "What is the traditional diagnosis?":
          "Early Blight is typically diagnosed through visual inspection. Characteristic lesions with concentric rings appear on older leaves, stems, and tubers. If necessary, laboratory tests like microscopic analysis or fungal cultures can confirm the presence of *Alternaria solani*. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests may be used for more precise identification of the pathogen.",
      "What are the preventive measures?":
          "Preventive measures include practicing crop rotation, removing plant debris, and avoiding overhead irrigation to reduce leaf wetness. Fungicides can be applied preventively during favorable conditions. Growing resistant potato varieties and ensuring plants receive adequate nutrients can help minimize disease severity. Proper spacing improves air circulation, reducing humidity around the plants."

Removing infected plants promptly and applying systemic fungicides like metalaxyl can help limit the spread. Resistant varieties and proper field sanitation are critical management strategies.",
      "What causes this disease?":
          "Late Blight is caused by *Phytophthora infestans*, a pathogen that spreads through water and wind-borne spores. Wet and cool conditions favor the development of the disease, which thrives in areas with prolonged leaf wetness. The pathogen can survive in infected plant debris or tubers.",
      "What are the common symptoms?":
          "Symptoms include large, dark brown or black lesions on leaves and stems, with a water-soaked appearance. White, fuzzy fungal growth may appear under moist conditions. Infected tubers develop brown, firm spots that penetrate deep into the flesh, making them unmarketable.",
      "What is the traditional diagnosis?":
          "Late Blight is traditionally diagnosed through visual symptoms like large, water-soaked lesions on leaves and stems, often accompanied by white, downy growth. In some cases, lab tests such as microscopic examination or DNA-based methods like PCR may be used to confirm *Phytophthora infestans* presence.",
      "What are the preventive measures?":
          "Preventive measures include using certified disease-free seed tubers, avoiding planting in poorly drained areas, and applying fungicides preventively during periods of high risk. Removing plant debris and tubers that harbor the pathogen is crucial. Resistant varieties and crop rotation can further reduce disease occurrence."

      "What are the common symptoms?":
          "Symptoms include small, dark, water-soaked spots on leaves and fruits. These spots can merge, causing large areas of necrosis. In severe cases, leaves may fall off, exposing fruits to sunscald and reducing yield. Infected fruits develop blemishes, making them unsellable.",
      "What is the traditional diagnosis?":
          "Bacterial Spot is diagnosed through visual inspection of characteristic symptoms like small, water-soaked lesions. Laboratory analysis, including bacterial isolation or molecular tests like PCR, can confirm the presence of *Xanthomonas*. Leaf and fruit samples may also be cultured for accurate identification.",
      "What are the preventive measures?":
          "Preventive measures include planting disease-resistant varieties, using certified disease-free seeds, and maintaining good field hygiene. Avoid overhead irrigation to reduce leaf wetness. Copper-based bactericides can be used preventively, and proper crop rotation helps minimize bacterial buildup in the soil."

      "What causes this disease?":
          "Early Blight is caused by the fungus *Alternaria solani*, which thrives in warm, wet conditions. The fungus survives in plant debris and can be spread through wind, rain, or contaminated tools. Stress factors like poor nutrition can increase susceptibility to infection.",
      "What are the common symptoms?":
          "Symptoms include dark, concentric rings on leaves, stems, and fruits. Older leaves are typically affected first, eventually leading to defoliation. Fruit lesions appear sunken and can cause premature fruit drop, reducing marketable yield. Stem cankers may also develop.",
      "What is the traditional diagnosis?":
          "Traditional diagnosis involves identifying dark, concentric lesions on older leaves, stems, and fruits. In cases where visual inspection is insufficient, laboratory analysis may be used to isolate *Alternaria solani*. Microscopic examination or fungal cultures can provide a more definitive diagnosis.",
      "What are the preventive measures?":
          "Preventive measures include practicing crop rotation, removing plant debris, and applying fungicides preventively. Overhead irrigation should be avoided to reduce leaf wetness.
